      The Mahabharata is an ancient Indian epic where the main story revolves
      around two branches of a family - the Pandavas and Kauravas - who, in the
      Kurukshetra War, battle for the throne of Hastinapura. Interwoven into
      this narrative are several smaller stories about people dead or living,
      and philosophical discourses. Krishna-Dwaipayan Vyasa, himself a character
      in the epic, composed it; as, according to tradition, he dictated the
      verses and Ganesha wrote them down.
      <br /><br />
      At 100,000 verses, it is the longest epic poem ever written, generally
      thought to have been composed in the 4th century BCE or earlier. The
      events in the epic play out in the Indian subcontinent and surrounding
      areas. It was first narrated by a student of Vyasa at a snake-sacrifice of
      the great-grandson of one of the major characters of the story. Including
      within it the Bhagavad Gita, the Mahabharata is one of the most important
      texts of ancient Indian, indeed world, literature. The prelude Shantanu,
      the king of Hastinapur, was married to Ganga (personification of the
      Ganges) with whom he had a son called Devavrat. Several years later, when
      Devavrat had grown up to be an accomplished prince, Shantanu fell in love
      with Satyavati. Her father refused to let her marry the king unless the
      king promised that Satyavati's son and descendants would inherit the
      throne. <br /><br />
      Unwilling to deny Devavrat his rights, Shantanu declined to do so but the
      prince, on coming to know of the matter, rode over to Satyavati's house,
      vowed to renounce the throne and to remain celibate throughout his life.
      The prince then took Satyavati home to the palace so that the king, his
      father, could marry her.<br /><br />
      On account of the terrible vow that he'd taken that day, Devavrat came to
      be known as Bheeshm. Shantanu was so pleased with his son that he granted
      to Devavrat the boon of choosing the time of his own death. In time,
      Shantanu and Satyavati had two sons. Soon thereafter, Shantanu died.
      Satyavati's sons still being minors, the affairs of the kingdom were
      managed by Bheeshm and Satyavati.<br /><br />
      By the time these sons reached adulthood, the elder one had died in a
      skirmish with some gandharvas (heavenly beings) so the younger son,
      Vichitravirya, was enthroned. Bheeshm then abducted the three princesses
      of a neighbouring kingdom and brought them over to Hastinapur to be wedded
      to Vichitravirya. The eldest of these princesses declared that she was in
      love with someone else, so she was let go; the two other princesses were
      married to Vichitravirya who died soon afterwards, childless.
      DHRITARASHTRA WAS THE STRONGEST OF ALL PRINCES IN THE COUNTRY, PANDU WAS
      SKILLED IN WARFARE & ARCHERY, & VIDUR KNEW ALL THE BRANCHES OF LEARNING,
      POLITICS, & STATESMANSHIP. Dhritarashtra, Pandu & Vidur So that the family
      line did not die out, Satyavati summoned her son Vyasa to impregnate the
      two queens. Vyasa had been born to Satyavati of a great sage named
      Parashar before her marriage to Shantanu. According to the laws of the
      day, a child born to an unwed mother was taken to be a step-child of the
      mother's husband; by that token, Vyasa could be considered Shantanu's son
      and could be used to perpetuate the Kuru clan that ruled Hastinapur. Thus,
      by the Niyog custom, the two queens each had a son of Vyasa: to the elder
      queen was born a blind son called Dhritarashtra, and to the younger was
      born an otherwise healthy but extremely pale son called Pandu. To a maid
      of these queens was born a son of Vyasa called Vidur.<br /><br />
      Bheeshm brought up these three boys with great care. Dhritarashtra grew up
      to be the strongest of all princes in the country, Pandu was extremely
      skilled in warfare and archery, and Vidur knew all the branches of
      learning, politics, and statesmanship. With the boys grown, it was now
      time to fill up the empty throne of Hastinapur. Dhritarashtra, the eldest,
      was bypassed because the laws barred a disabled person from being king.
      Pandu, instead, was crowned. Bheeshm negotiated Dhritarashtra's marriage
      with Gandhari, and Pandu's with Kunti and Madri. Pandu expanded the
      kingdom by conquering the sorrounding areas, and brought in considerable
      war booty. With things running smoothly in the country, and with its
      coffers full, Pandu asked his elder brother to look after the state
      affairs, and retired to the forests with his two wives for some time
      off.<br /><br />
      Kauravas & PAndavas A few years later, Kunti returned to Hastinapur. With
      her were five little boys, and the bodies of Pandu and Madri. The five
      boys were the sons of Pandu, born to his two wives through the Niyog
      custom from gods: the eldest was born of Dharma, the second of Vayu, the
      third of Indra, and the youngest - twins - of the Ashvins. In the
      meanwhile, Dhritarashtra and Gandhari too had had children of their own:
      100 sons and one daughter. The Kuru elders performed the last rites for
      Pandu and Madri, and Kunti and the children were welcomed into the palace.
      Pandavas Pandavas Bob King (CC BY) All of the 105 princes were
      subsequently entrusted to the care of a teacher: Kripa at first and,
      additionally, Drona later. Drona's school at Hastinapur attracted several
      other boys; Karna, of the Suta clan was one such boy. <br /><br />It was
      here that hostilities quickly developed between the sons of Dhritarashtra
      (collectively called the Kauravas, patronymic of their ancestor Kuru) and
      the sons of Pandu (collectively called the Pandavas, patronymic of their
      father). Duryodhana, the eldest Kaurava, tried - and failed - to poison
      Bheem, the second Pandava. Karna, because of his rivalry in archery with
      the third Pandava, Arjuna, allied himself with Duryodhan. In time, the
      princes learnt all they could from their teachers, and the Kuru elders
      decided to hold a public skills exhibition of the princes. It was during
      this exhibition that the citizens became plainly aware of the hostilities
      between the two branches of the royal family: Duryodhan and Bheem had a
      mace fight that had to be stopped before things turned ugly, Karna -
      uninvited as he was not a Kuru prince - challenged Arjuna, was insulted on
      account of his non-royal birth, and was crowned king of a vassal state on
      the spot by Duryodhan. It was also around this time that questions began
      to be raised about Dhritarashtra occupying the throne, since he was
      supposed to be holding it only in trust for Pandu, the crowned king. To
      keep peace in the realm, Dhritarashtra declared the eldest Pandava,
      Yudhishthir, as the crown prince and heir apparent. The Kuru Family Tree
      The Kuru Family Tree Anindita Basu (CC BY-NC-SA) The first exile
      Yudhishthir's being the crown prince and his rising popularity with the
      citizens was extremely distasteful to Duryodhan, who saw himself as the
      rightful heir since his father was the de facto king. He plotted to get
      rid of the Pandavas.<br /><br />
      This he did by getting his father to send the Pandavas and Kunti off to a
      nearby town on the pretext of a fair that was held there. The palace in
      which the Pandavas were to stay in that town was built by an agent of
      Duryodhan; the palace was made entirely of inflammable materials since the
      plan was to burn down the palace - together with the Pandavas and Kunti -
      once they'd settled in. The Pandavas, however, were alerted to this fact
      by their other uncle, Vidur, and had a counter plan ready; they dug an
      escape tunnel underneath their chambers. One night, the Pandavas gave out
      a huge feast which all of the townsfolk came to. At that feast, a forest
      woman and her five sons found themselves so well-fed and well-drunk that
      they could no longer walk straight; they passed out on the floor of the
      hall.<br /><br />
      That very night, the Pandavas themselves set fire to the palace and
      escaped through the tunnel. When the flames had died down, the townsfolk
      discovered the bones of the forest woman and her boys, and mistook them
      for Kunti and the Pandavas. Duryodhan thought his plan had succeeded and
      that the world was free of the Pandavas. Arjuna & Draupadi Meanwhile, the
      Pandavas and Kunti went into hiding, moving from one place to another and
      passing themselves off as a poor brahmin family.<br /><br />
      They would seek shelter with some villager for a few weeks, the princes
      would go out daily to beg for food, return in the evenings and hand over
      the day's earnings to Kunti who would divide the food into two: one half
      was for the strongman Bheem and the other half was shared by the others.
      During these wanderings, Bheem killed two demons, married a demoness, and
      had a demon child called Ghatotkach. They then heard about a swayamvar (a
      ceremony to choose a suitor) being organised for the princess of Panchal,
      and went at Panchal to see the festivities. According to their practice,
      they left their mother home and set out for alms: they reached the
      swayamvar hall where the king was giving away things most lavishly to alms
      seekers. <br /><br />The brothers sat themselves down in the hall to watch
      the fun: the princess Draupadi, born of fire, was famed for her beauty and
      every prince from every country for miles around had come to the
      swayamvar, hoping to win her hand. The conditions of the swayamvar were
      difficult: a long pole on the ground had a circular contraption spinning
      at its top. On this moving disc was attached a fish. At the bottom of the
      pole was a shallow urn of water. A person had to look down into this
      water-mirror, use the bow and five arrows that were provided, and pierce
      the fish spinning on top. Five attempts were allowed. It was evident that
      only an extremely skilled archer, such as the now-presumed-dead Arjuna,
      could pass the test. <br /><br />Arjuna at the Draupadi Swayamvar Arjuna
      at the Draupadi Swayamvar Charles Haynes (CC BY-SA) One by one, the kings
      and princes tried to shoot the fish, and failed. Some could not even lift
      the bow; some could not string it. The Kauravas and Karna were also
      present. Karna picked up the bow and strung it in a moment, but was
      prevented from taking aim when Draupadi declared she would not marry
      anyone from the Suta clan. After every one of the royals had failed,
      Arjuna, the third Pandava, stepped up to the pole, picked up the bow,
      strung it, affixed all of the five arrows to it, looked down into the
      water, aimed, shot, and pierced the fish's eye with all of the five arrows
      in a single attempt. Arjuna had won Draupadi's hand. The Pandava brothers,
      still in the guise of poor brahmins, took Draupadi back to the hut they
      were staying at and shouted for Kunti, "Ma, Ma, come and see what we've
      brought back today." Kunti, saying, "Whatever it is, share it among
      yourselves", came out of the hut, saw that it wasn't alms but the most
      beautiful woman she had ever set her eyes on, and stood stock still as the
      import of her words sank in on everybody present.<br /><br />Meanwhile,
      Draupadi's twin Dhrishtadyumna, unhappy that his royal sister should be
      married off to a poor commoner, had secretly followed the Pandavas back to
      their hut. Also following them secretly was a dark prince and his fair
      brother - Krishna and Balaram of the Yadava clan - who had suspected that
      the unknown archer could be none other than Arjuna, who had been presumed
      dead at the palace-burning incident several months ago. These princes were
      related to the Pandavas - their father was Kunti's brother - but they had
      never met before. By design or happenstance, Vyasa also arrived at the
      scene at this point and the Pandava hut was alive for a while with happy
      cries of meetings and reunions. <br /><br />To keep Kunti's words, it was
      decided that Draupadi would be the common wife of all of the five
      Pandavas. Her brother, Dhrishtadyumna, and her father, the king Drupad,
      were reluctant with this unusual arrangement but were talked around to it
      by Vyasa and Yudhishthir. Places in the Mahabharata Places in the
      Mahabharata Anindita Basu (CC BY-NC-SA) Indraprastha & the dice game After
      the wedding ceremonies at Panchal were over, the Hastinapur palace invited
      the Pandavas and their bride back. Dhritarashtra made a great show of
      happiness on discovering that the Pandavas were alive after all, and he
      partitioned the kingdom, giving them a huge tract of barren land to settle
      in and rule over. The Pandavas transformed this land into a paradise.
      Yudhishthir was crowned there, and he performed a sacrifice that involved
      all of the kings of the land to accept - either voluntarily or by force -
      his suzerainty. <br /><br />The new kingdom, Indraprastha, prospered.
      Meanwhile, the Pandavas had entered into an agreement among themselves
      regarding Draupadi: she was to be wife of each Pandava, by turn, for a
      year. If any Pandava was to enter the room where she was present with her
      husband-of-that-year, that Pandava was to be exiled for 12 years. It so
      happened that once Draupadi and Yudhishthir, her husband of that year,
      were present in the armoury when Arjuna entered it to take his bow and
      arrows. Consequently, he went off in exile during which he toured the
      entire country, down to its southernmost tip, and married three princesses
      he met along the way. <br /><br />The prosperity of Indraprastha and the
      power of the Pandavas was not something that Duryodhan liked. He invited
      Yudhisthir to a dice game and got his uncle, Shakuni, to play on his
      (Duryodhan's) behalf. Shakuni was an accomplished player; Yudhishthir
      staked - and lost - step by step his entire wealth, his kingdom, his
      brothers, himself, and Draupadi. Draupadi was dragged into the dice hall
      and insulted. There was an attempt to disrobe her, and Bheem lost his
      temper and vowed to kill each and every one of the Kauravas. Things came
      to such a boil that Dhritarashtra intervened unwillingly, gave the kingdom
      and their freedom back to the Pandavas and Draupadi, and set them off back
      to Indraprastha. This angered Duryodhan, who talked his father around, and
      invited Yudhishthir to another dice game. This time, the condition was
      that the loser would go on a 12-year exile followed by a year of life
      incognito. If they were to be discovered during this incognito period, the
      loser would have to repeat the 12+1 cycle. The dice game was played.
      Yudhishthir lost again. Draupadi Humiliated, Mahabharata Draupadi
      Humiliated, Mahabharata Basholi School (Public Domain) The second exile
      For this exile, the Pandavas left their ageing mother Kunti behind at
      Hastinapur, in Vidur's place. They lived in forests, hunted game, and
      visited holy spots. At around this time, Yudhishthir asked Arjuna to go to
      the heavens in quest of celestial weapons because, by now, it was apparent
      that their kingdom would not be returned to them peacefully after the
      exile and that they would have to fight for it.<br /><br />
      Arjuna did so, and not only did he learn the techniques of several divine
      weapons from the gods, he also learnt how to sing and dance from the
      gandharvas. After 12 years, the Pandavas went incognito for a year. During
      this one-year period, they lived in the Virat kingdom. Yudhishthir took up
      employment as a king's counsellor, Bheem worked in the royal kitchens,
      Arjuna turned himself into a eunuch and taught the palace maidens how to
      sing and dance, the twins worked at the royal stables, and Draupadi became
      a handmaiden to the queen. At the end of the incognito period - during
      which they were not discovered despite Duryodhan's best efforts - the
      Pandavas revealed themselves. The Virat king was overwhelmed; he offered
      his daughter in marriage to Arjuna but he declined since he had been her
      dance teacher the past year and students were akin to children. The
      princess was married, instead, to Arjuna's son Abhimanyu. At this wedding
      ceremony, a large number of Pandava allies gathered to draw out a war
      strategy.<br /><br />
      Meanwhile, emissaries had been sent to Hastinapur to demand Indraprastha
      back but the missions had failed. Krishna himself went on a peace mission
      and failed. Duryodhan refused to give away as much land as was covered by
      the point of a needle, let alone the five villages proposed by the peace
      missions. The Kauravas also gathered their allies around them, and even
      broke away a key Pandava ally - the maternal uncle of the Pandava twins -
      by trickery.<br /><br />
      War became inevitable. Arjuna During the Battle of Kurukshetra Arjuna
      During the Battle of Kurukshetra Unknown (Public Domain) The Kurukshetra
      war & aftermath Just before the war bugle was sounded, Arjuna saw arrayed
      before him his relatives: his great-grandfather Bheeshm who had
      practically brought him up, his teachers Kripa and Drona, his brothers the
      Kauravas, and, for a moment, his resolution wavered. Krishna, the warrior
      par excellence, had given up arms for this war and had elected to be
      Arjuna's charioteer. To him Arjuna said, "Take me back, Krishna. I can't
      kill these people. They're my father, my brothers, my teachers, my uncles,
      my sons. What good is a kingdom that's gained at the cost of their lives?"
      Then followed a philosophical discourse that has today become a separate
      book on its own - the Bhagavad Gita. Krishna explained the impermanence of
      life to Arjuna, and the importance of doing one's duty and of sticking to
      the right path. Arjuna picked up his bow again.<br /><br />
      सुखदुखे समे कृत्वा लाभालाभौ जयाजयौ। ततो युद्धाय युज्यस्व नैवं
      पापमवाप्स्यप्ति।। If you proceed to war treating equally joy and sorrow,
      gain and loss, victory and defeat, you do not sin. [2.38]
      कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन । मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते
      सङ्गोऽस्त्वकर्मणि ॥ You have a right only to work; you have no claim to
      the fruits thereof. Do not let an expected result dictate your actions; do
      not sit idle either. [2.47] The battle raged for 18 days. The army
      totalled 18 akshauhinis, 7 on the Panadava side and 11 on the Kaurava (1
      akshauhini = 21,870 chariots + 21,870 elephants + 65,610 horses + 109,350
      soldiers on foot). Casualties on both sides were high. When it all ended,
      the Pandavas had won the war but lost almost everyone they held dear.
      Duryodhan and all of the Kauravas had died, as had all of the menfolk of
      Draupadi's family, including all of her sons by the Pandavas. The now-dead
      Karna was revealed to be a son of Kunti's from before her marriage to
      Pandu, and thus, the eldest Pandava and the rightful heir to the throne.
      The grand old man, Bheeshm, lay dying; their teacher Drona was dead as
      were several kinsfolk related to them either by blood or by marriage. In
      about 18 days, the entire country lost almost three generations of its
      men. It was a war not seen on a scale before, it was the Great Indian war,
      the Maha-bharat. After the war, Yudhishthir became king of Hastinapur and
      Indraprastha. The Pandavas ruled for 36 years, after which they abdicated
      in favour of Abhimanyu's son, Parikshit. The Pandavas and Draupadi
      proceeded on foot to the Himalayas, intending to live out their last days
      climbing the slopes heavenwards. One by one, they fell on this last
      journey and their spirits ascended to the heavens. Years later,
      Parikshit's son succeeded his father as king. He held a big sacrifice, at
      which this entire story was recited for the first time by a disciple of
      Vyasa called Vaishampayan. legacy Since that time, this story has been
      retold countless times, expanded upon, and retold again. The Mahabharata
      remains popular to this day in India. It has been adapted and recast in
      contemporary mode in several films and plays. Children continue to be
      named after the characters in the epic. The Bhagvad Gita is one of the
      holiest of Hindu scriptures. Beyond India, the Mahabharata story is
      popular in south-east Asia in cultures that were influenced by Hinduism
      such as Indonesia and Malaysia.
